# LiMo-OpenSTA
This project extends OpenSTA to support Multi-Input Switching (MIS) timing analysis using machine learning.  By default, OpenSTA only supports Single Input Switching (SIS). This modification enables dynamic delay annotation for MIS conditions by hooking a trained ML model into the STA flow.
